      <head>Recording Location and Taping System History</head>
      <p>Beginning in 1971, President Richard Nixon authorized the installation of a secret taping system in selected portions of the White House, Cabinet Room, Oval Office, Old Executive Office Building, and Camp David. Collectively, these recordings constitute the Nixon Administration's White House Tapes.</p>
      <p>In February 1971, the United State Secret Service installed listening devices in the White House. They placed seven microphones in the Oval Office: five in the President's desk and one on each side of the fireplace. The Secret Service technicians wired these devices to central mixers that were then connected to recorders in an old locker room in the White House basement. These recordings became known as the Oval Office recordings.</p>
      <p>This system was a secret taping system maintained by the Secret Service. Only President Nixon, H. R. Haldeman, and a few of the President's close personal assistants knew the system existed. One of its key features was that the recording equipment in the Oval Office, the EOB office, at Camp David, and on the telephones was sound-activated, operating without a conscious decision by the President to record a specific conversation. The taping system was tied to the Presidential Locator System, which was also operated by the Secret Service, and was designed to continue recording for fifteen to thirty seconds after the President left the room.</p>
      <p>On July 16, 1973, Special Assistant to the President Alexander Butterfield revealed the existence of the White House taping system during his testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee. Following this public revelation, White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig ordered the removal of the entire presidential taping system.</p>

        <head>Conversation Summary</head>
        <p>On July 19, 1972, President Richard M. Nixon and unknown person(s) met in the Oval Office of the White House at an unknown time between 12:37 pm and 12:44 pm. The Oval Office taping system captured this recording, which is known as Conversation 747-013 of the White House Tapes.</p>

        <scopecontent id="audioQuality">
          <head>Audio Quality</head>
          <p>The audio quality of the Nixon White House Tapes is generally poor. While some locations generated better quality recordings than others, inferior recording equipment, cheap tape stock, improper microphone placement, taping system malfunctions, volume fluctuation, background noise, and electrical interference contributed to the poor quality of the recordings. Other noises greatly affect the audibility of conversations, including such small happenings as the signing of documents or the clinking of coffee cups.</p>
          <p>As a result of the microphone coverage, Oval Office conversations have clear audio relative to other Nixon White House Tapes. Even still, extraneous room noises and background sounds are evident and can obscure portions of conversations. The microphones in the desk picked up the sound of anyone writing on the desk or the setting down a coffee cup or a glass. Furthermore, the desk microphones captured the sound of President Nixon's chair banging into the desk, the President's feet banging on the desk as he put his feet up, and the sound of the President's knees knocking against the kneewell of his desk. The microphone installed near the telephone captured the ringing of the telephone, which sometimes blocked out small portions of conversation. On occasion, the helicopter rotor blades from Marine One completely obliterated conversation taking place in the Oval Office. The recording system also captured the sirens of ambulances, fire engines, and police vehicles as they blared in through open windows. On occasion, the opening and closing of interior and exterior doors briefly interfered with conversations.</p>

        <scopecontent id="natureOfRecording">
          <head>Nature of the Recording</head>
          <p>The White House Tapes comprise secretly recorded human conversation. Most participants were unaware that their meetings and telephone calls were being recorded. The taping system captured often unstructured and free-flowing discussions between close personal associates intimately familiar with the topic. As a result, users may find the recorded conversations difficult to follow.</p>

          <head>Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act of 1974</head>
          <p>The Nixon-era White House Tapes are subject to the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act of 1974 (PRMPA). PRMPA, which applies only to the Nixon Presidential Materials, stipulates that those materials relevant to the understanding of Abuse of Governmental Power and Watergate are to be processed and released to the public prior to the release of all other materials. Materials related to the Abuse of Governmental Power and the constitutional and statutory duties of the President and his White House staff are retained by the National Archives. PRMPA mandated the promulgation of access restrictions for the processing of the Nixon Tapes.</p>
          <p>The resulting Nixon Public Acccess Regulations 36 CFR 1275 state that the National Archives must segregate and return to the estate of former President Nixon those materials identified as purely "personal-private" or "personal-political," and unrelated to the President's constitutional and statutory duties. This conversation has been processed under these regulations.</p>

        <acqinfo id="acqDeed2007">
          <head>2007 Deed of Gift</head>
          <p>However, in 2007, the estate of Richard Nixon negotiated a Deed of Gift with the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. By this agreement, materials deemed "personal-political" have been deeded back to the National Archives for release to the public. Materials originally deemed "person-private" have been deeded back to the National Archives, with the exception of materials concerning the medical history or non-Watergate-related personal finances of Richard Nixon or the non-public activities of the First Family.</p>
          <p id="expected-ReReview">Upon re-review of this conversation, provisions of the 2007 Deed of Gift between the estate of Richard Nixon and the National Archives will be implemented, where appropriate, to enhance access to materials. Changes in access will be noted once implemented.</p>
