				<head>Nature of Recording</head>
				
				<p>This conversation was captured by the recording system in the White House's Oval Office, in Washington, D.C.</p>
				
				<p>In February 1971, the United States Secret Service, at the request of President Richard Nixon, installed recording devices in the White House. They placed seven microphones in the Oval Office: five in the President's desk and two in the wall sconces on either side of the fireplace.</p>
			    
				<p>As a result of the microphone coverage, Oval Office conversations have clear audio relative to other Nixon White House Tapes. Even still, extraneous room noises and background sounds are evident and can obscure portions of conversations. The microphones in the desk picked up the sound of anyone writing on the desk or the setting down a coffee cup or a glass. Furthermore, the desk microphones captured the sound of President Nixon's chair banging into the desk, the President's feet banging on the desk as he put his feet up, and the sound of the President's knees knocking against the kneewell of his desk. The microphone installed near the telephone captured the ringing of the telephone, which sometimes blocked out small portions of conversation. On occasion, the helicopter rotor blades from Marine One completely obliterated conversation taking place in the Oval Office. The recording system also captured the sirens of ambulances, fire engines, and police vehicles as they blared in through open windows. On occasion, the opening and closing of interior and exterior doors briefly interfered with conversations.</p>

					<head>About the Subject Log</head>
			
					<p>To assist listeners in understanding the conversation and finding segments pertinent to their own interests, a team of archivists has created a Subject Log, which outlines major topics, names, and organizations in sequential order.</p>
					
					<list id="loggingNotes" type="marked">
						
						<item>Logs include action statements, which indicate when someone entered or exited a room. Action statements are underlined.</item>
						
						<item>If a conversation recorded in one of the offices also captures a telephone conversation, a cross-reference to the corresponding telephone recording is provided.</item>
						
						<item>If a telephone recording also captures a conversation taking place in one of the offices, a cross-reference to the corresponding room conversation is provided.</item>
						
						<item>Logs indicate which portions, if any, were reviewed under the 2007 Deed of Gift.</item>
						
						<item>In some cases, the Watergate Special Prosecution Force or court-ordered mandates resulted in a transcript of the entire conversation or portions of conversation. For these portions, archivists have provided a citation to the related transcript<!--, in place of subject logging -->.</item>
					</list>

				<arrangement>
					
					<head>Audio Format</head>
				
					<p>This conversation was recorded to audiotape on a system maintained by the United States Secret Service. The National Archives transferred the original audiotape to Digital Audio Tape (DAT), which, in turn, was later converted to digital audio files.</p>
					
					<p>The audio recording of this conversation has been digitized and made available to the public. <!-- For portions that have been deemed withdrawn (withheld), a ten-second tone replaces the removed portion. --></p>

					<p>The Nixon-era White House Tapes are subject to the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA) of 1974. PRMPA, which applies only to the Nixon Presidential Materials, stipulates that those materials relevant to the understanding of Abuse of Governmental Power and Watergate are to be processed and released to the public prior to the release of all other materials. Materials related to the Abuse of Governmental Power and the constitutional and statutory duties of the President and his White House staff are retained by the National Archives. PRMPA mandated the promulgation of access restrictions for the processing of the Nixon Tapes.</p>
					
					<p>The resulting Nixon Public Acccess Regulations 36 CFR 1275 state that the National Archives must segregate and return to the estate of former President Nixon those materials identified as purely &quot;personal-private&quot; or &quot;personal-political,&quot; and unrelated to the President's constitutional and statutory duties. This conversation has been processed under these regulations.</p>

					<head>2007 Deed of Gift</head>
					
					<p>However, in 2007, the estate of Richard Nixon negotiated a Deed of Gift with the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. By this agreement, materials deemed &quot;personal-political&quot; have been deeded back to the National Archives for release to the public. Materials originally deemed &quot;person-private&quot; have been deeded back to the National Archives, with the exception of materials concerning the medical history or non-Watergate-related personal finances of Richard Nixon or the non-public activities of the First Family.</p>
					
					<p>Upon re-review of this conversation, provisions of the 2007 Deed of Gift between the estate of Richard Nixon and the National Archives will be implemented, where appropriate, to enhance access to materials. Changes in access will be noted once implemented.</p>
